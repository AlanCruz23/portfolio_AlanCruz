  <h2>Unit 1:HTML</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</li>
    <ul> <li>I think the important terms are being able to do the structure of the website and its content. </li> </ul>
    <li>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?</li>
    <ul> <li>The most important skill that I learned from this unit is to creat a web page with all of its elements. </li> </ul>
    <li>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?</li>
    <ul> <li> I have gotten better by doing the practice in code academy it teaches me how to do certain things that are important for a web page. </li> </ul>
     <li>In what ways do you think you need to improve?What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?</li>
     <ul> <li>I need to improve by remembering the steps that code academy has taught me how to do them, the way I resolve them is by going back to the lessons on code academy and seeing them how they are done. </li> </ul>
     <li>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?</li>
     <ul> <li>It was satisfying because I did something that I never did before and to accomplish the web page was a difficult thing to do because I had to use all the steps that code academy. </li> </ul>
     <li>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece? </li>
     <ul> <li> If I were the teacher I would say that it is good but it could be better because I could add way more things to it to make it look better. </li> </ul>
